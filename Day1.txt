In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created. 
HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate. 
In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. 
One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.
